However, much of this progress has stemmed from technological advancements in production processes‚Äîsomething that, while valuable, is not enough. To truly reduce the sector‚Äôs environmental footprint, more focused and comprehensive actions are needed.\n\nSteel is widely used and is also one of the most recycled materials in the world. Yet, its production is extremely energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures and abundant fossil fuel usage‚Äîprimarily coal and oil. This makes the iron and steel sector a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, contributing around 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs climate change concerns grow, stakeholders‚Äîincluding investors, regulators, and customers‚Äîare demanding more sustainable practices. To meet these demands, businesses must rethink outdated methods and invest in ESDD to make their operations future-ready and environmentally responsible.",

The domestic steel sector has grown by more than 75% since 2008, also reflecting an 80% surge in national demand.\n\nThis growth reflects the country‚Äôs broader economic development, and the Indian government is playing an active role in promoting it. For example, the Union Budget 2023‚Äì24 allocated ‚Çπ70.15 crore (USD 8.6 million) to the Ministry of Steel. Mergers within the industry and increasing foreign investments are further driving expansion.\n\nHowever, this rapid growth raises concerns about sustainability. Reports show that steel production in India emits around 2.55 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ per tonne of steel‚Äîfar higher than the global average of 1.85 tonnes. This highlights the urgent need to incorporate environmental and social due diligence to assess and manage the negative effects of production.",

While it draws heavily from ITIL, ISO 20000 is compatible with other frameworks such as the Microsoft Operations Framework and ISACA's COBIT. To become an international standard, ISO 20000 had to receive approval from a majority of ISO member countries. \n ISO 20000 Certification ensures that IT departments align their service management processes with global best practices and business objectives.

Foreign companies register liaison offices in India to assess market potential and support business opportunities without engaging in direct commercial activities. These offices serve as a link between the Indian market and the international parent organization. Their primary objectives include promoting import/export relations, fostering technical and financial collaborations, conducting market research, and collecting feedback from Indian consumers. Liaison offices are highly valued by foreign investors as they offer a strategic way to explore the Indian market with minimal financial, legal, and operational obligations.",

The process includes geophysical surveys, drilling, utility clearance, and laboratory testing, all performed following strict standards such as ASTM guidelines. Certified experts prepare detailed reports with findings and recommendations, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

The ultimate goal is to reduce carbon emissions and enhance the well-being of occupants through naturally comfortable environments.

If objections arise (examination report), the applicant must respond within the specified time (usually 30 days) with arguments and evidence; a hearing may be granted if required.\n\nStep 4: Publication in the Trademark Journal\n‚Ä¢ If the examiner accepts the mark after examination and replies, it is published in the Trademark Journal for four months to invite opposition from third parties.\n\nStep 5: Opposition and Disposal\n‚Ä¢ Third parties may oppose during the publication period. If opposed, contested proceedings follow with evidence exchange, hearings and adjudication by the Registrar.\n\nStep 6: Registration Certificate\n‚Ä¢ On successful completion of the opposition period (no opposition) or disposal in favour of the applicant, the Registrar issues a registration certificate.\n\nStep 7: Renewal\n‚Ä¢ Registered trademarks are valid for ten years and renewable indefinitely in ten-year blocks by paying the prescribed renewal fee.",

SPCB Review & Recommendation: The SPCB/PCC examines the application for technical adequacy, environmental safeguards and local acceptability. The SPCB/PCC processes the application and, where appropriate, forwards its recommendation to the MoEFCC within 30 days with any safety stipulations, conditions or observations.\n\n3. Prior Informed Consent (PIC): For wastes governed by international transboundary movement rules, the importer must secure a Prior Informed Consent (PIC) or equivalent export permission from the exporting country's competent authority. The MoEFCC will generally require verification of PIC before granting import authorisation.\n\n4. MoEFCC NOC / Authorisation: The MoEFCC considers the SPCB recommendation and the PIC (where applicable). If satisfied, MoEFCC issues the No Objection Certificate (NOC) or import authorisation specifying permitted waste categories, quantities, conditions (transport, storage, treatment, reporting), validity period and monitoring obligations.\n\n5. Customs & Port Formalities: On grant of authorisation, the importer must comply with Customs import procedures, present the MoEFCC authorisation/NOC and PIC documents at port of entry, and ensure authorised routing to the nominated facility.\n\n6. Ongoing Compliance: The authorised importer/operator must maintain records, submit periodic returns, permit inspections, comply with monitoring and reporting conditions, and ensure environmentally sound management until final recovery or dispatch (if re-export is required).",

The industry caters to various sectors including e-commerce (42%), food and beverages (28%), pharmaceuticals (18%), and consumer goods (12%). Key drivers fueling this growth include the government's plastic ban initiative, rising eco-consciousness among consumers, 100% FDI allowance under the automatic route, and the 'Make in India' push.

          "Paper packaging offers significant advantages across environmental, economic and operational dimensions.\n\nEnvironmental benefits: Paper packaging is 100% biodegradable, decomposing within 2 to 6 months, and enjoys an estimated 70% recyclability rate in India. Compared to plastic alternatives, paper packaging typically carries a carbon footprint approximately 30% lower ‚Äî an important advantage as corporate buyers and regulators prioritise life-cycle impacts.\n\nEconomic benefits: In many value chains raw material costs for paper-based packaging are substantially lower than plastics (the guidance provided estimates raw material costs may be ~60% cheaper than plastics in certain contexts). Financial incentives are often available: new manufacturing units can benefit from a 25% capital subsidy under selected MSME schemes and, in some cases, a 15% income tax rebate subject to scheme conditions.\n\nOperational benefits: Paper packaging production cycles are typically faster for many SKUs (estimated ~20% faster than certain plastic moulding processes), enabling quicker lead times. Customization for branding is easier with print and finishing options, and lighter, stackable packaging lowers logistics and warehousing costs. These operational characteristics reduce time-to-market and improve packaging economics for brands and retailers.",

Infrastructure development ‚Äî construction of factory buildings, utilities (power, water), effluent treatment plant (ETP) where required, internal roads and storage ‚Äî this phase typically spans 120 to 180 days depending on scale and contractor availability.\n\n4. Machinery procurement & installation ‚Äî purchase of corrugators, die-cutters, printing and finishing lines, pulp or corrugating machines, depending on product mix. Installation and commissioning usually take 4 to 8 weeks (2 months typical) after delivery.\n\n5. Trial production & quality testing ‚Äî run trial batches, set up quality control laboratory, obtain BIS/other product certifications and approvals; typical trial & testing timeframe ~1 month.\n\n6. Commercial launch ‚Äî production ramp-up, vendor on-boarding for raw materials (waste paper suppliers), hiring and training of operators, and marketing/sales outreach.\n\nNote: certain processes like BIS certification or pollution clearance may require concurrent submissions and site inspections.
