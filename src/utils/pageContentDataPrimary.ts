However, much of this progress has stemmed from technological advancements in production processes—something that, while valuable, is not enough. To truly reduce the sector’s environmental footprint, more focused and comprehensive actions are needed.\n\nSteel is widely used and is also one of the most recycled materials in the world. Yet, its production is extremely energy-intensive, requiring high temperatures and abundant fossil fuel usage—primarily coal and oil. This makes the iron and steel sector a significant emitter of carbon dioxide, contributing around 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs climate change concerns grow, stakeholders—including investors, regulators, and customers—are demanding more sustainable practices. To meet these demands, businesses must rethink outdated methods and invest in ESDD to make their operations future-ready and environmentally responsible.",

The domestic steel sector has grown by more than 75% since 2008, also reflecting an 80% surge in national demand.\n\nThis growth reflects the country’s broader economic development, and the Indian government is playing an active role in promoting it. For example, the Union Budget 2023–24 allocated ₹70.15 crore (USD 8.6 million) to the Ministry of Steel. Mergers within the industry and increasing foreign investments are further driving expansion.\n\nHowever, this rapid growth raises concerns about sustainability. Reports show that steel production in India emits around 2.55 tonnes of CO₂ per tonne of steel—far higher than the global average of 1.85 tonnes. This highlights the urgent need to incorporate environmental and social due diligence to assess and manage the negative effects of production.",

          "1. Financial Constraints\nBeing a capital-intensive industry, the iron and steel sector requires heavy investment. For instance, establishing just 1 tonne of steel-making capacity may cost around INR 7,000 crore. The high cost of financing, especially in India compared to developed nations like China or South Korea, discourages fresh investments.\n\nMaintaining an in-house team to ensure ESDD compliance can significantly add to operational expenses. That’s where dostartup services from DoStartup offer an edge—providing expert solutions without the burden of internal overheads.",
          "2. Complicated Regulatory Landscape\nThe sector is governed by a labyrinth of environmental and social regulations that frequently change. For small and medium enterprises (SMEs), staying updated without professional help is nearly impossible. Misinterpretation of laws often results in costly legal or compliance errors.\n\nWith DoStartup on your side, you gain access to regulatory experts who help decode these evolving requirements and implement best practices with ease.",
          "3. Lack of Reliable Data\nEffective due diligence is nearly impossible without accurate data. Unfortunately, most companies in this industry suffer from fragmented and insufficient datasets. Limited tools and technology make matters worse.\n\nOur dostartup team at DoStartup helps organizations collect, structure, and analyze data in compliance with ESDD standards—ensuring no critical insight is missed.",

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permits foreign parent companies to establish a project office in India for executing specific projects. This setup allows the overseas parent company to represent its business interests during project execution. However, to establish a project office, the foreign company must have an active contractual agreement with an Indian entity—either from the private or government sector. Additionally, the activities performed by the Project Office must remain within the scope defined in the contract. Project Office establishment and compliance are regulated under Section 6(6) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. The RBI has the sole authority to approve applications, while compliance with the Companies Act, 2013 requires the foreign company to register with the Registrar of Companies (ROC).",

          "Phase II Soil and Groundwater Investigations, also known as Phase II Environmental Site Assessments (ESA), are critical for assessing environmental risks related to a property. These assessments are typically initiated when a Phase I ESA reveals Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs). The main objective is to identify and measure contamination in soil and groundwater, refine site characterization, and evaluate potential risks to human health, the environment, and property development. The process includes geophysical surveys, drilling, utility clearance, and laboratory testing, all performed following strict standards such as ASTM guidelines. Certified experts prepare detailed reports with findings and recommendations, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Key advantages include early detection of environmental hazards, optimized project planning, regulatory adherence, and improved community and environmental health. These investigations are vital for sustainable development by supporting informed decision-making that balances economic growth with ecological preservation.",

Post-NOC, the applicant must follow water conservation measures such as artificial recharge, water reuse, and rainwater harvesting to maintain long-term environmental sustainability and stay compliant with CGWA norms.",

        question: "What is the process for renewal of CGWA NOC?",
        answer:
          "The NOC from CGWA is valid for a limited duration (usually 2 to 5 years). The renewal must be applied for before the expiry of the existing certificate. The process includes: submitting a compliance report of the previous NOC period; updating any changes in groundwater use or project status; revalidating recharge structures and water metering installations. Do Startup can assist you in renewing your NOC without delays or non-compliance risks.",

      {
        question:
          "Is there a provision for extension of Central Ground Water NOC?",
        answer:
          "Yes, there is a provision to apply for an extension of CGWA NOC in specific cases, such as project delays or continued groundwater needs under the same operational terms. The applicant must provide a justification along with relevant documentation and compliance history to seek an extension. Approval is at the discretion of the Authority based on compliance and environmental impact.",

File in the appropriate class(es) with accurate applicant details, representation of the mark (if any), and goods/services specification.\n• On filing you receive an application number for tracking.\n\nStep 3: Examination by Trademark Office\n• Examiner verifies registrability — distinctiveness, descriptiveness, conflicts with earlier marks and compliance with formal requirements.\n• If accepted, the mark proceeds to publication. If objections arise (examination report), the applicant must respond within the specified time (usually 30 days) with arguments and evidence; a hearing may be granted if required.\n\nStep 4: Publication in the Trademark Journal\n• If the examiner accepts the mark after examination and replies, it is published in the Trademark Journal for four months to invite opposition from third parties.\n\nStep 5: Opposition and Disposal\n• Third parties may oppose during the publication period. If opposed, contested proceedings follow with evidence exchange, hearings and adjudication by the Registrar.\n\nStep 6: Registration Certificate\n• On successful completion of the opposition period (no opposition) or disposal in favour of the applicant, the Registrar issues a registration certificate.\n\nStep 7: Renewal\n• Registered trademarks are valid for ten years and renewable indefinitely in ten-year blocks by paying the prescribed renewal fee."
