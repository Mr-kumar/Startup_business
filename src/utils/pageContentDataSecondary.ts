        question: "What is the validity of the ISI Mark Certification?",
        answer:
          "The ISI certificate remains valid for one year from the date of issue. Manufacturers must renew it annually by adhering to BIS compliance standards. Renewal ensures that the product continues to meet the required quality parameters set by BIS.",

          "How long does it take to obtain an ISI Certificate in India?",

However, depending on factors such as documentation, testing procedures, and factory inspection timelines, the process may extend up to 180 days. With DoStartup, this process is handled efficiently to minimize delays.",
